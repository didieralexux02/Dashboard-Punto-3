## Overview

DashEngine processes a withdrawal requests Excel file, runs the full decision engine, and presents the results as an interactive analytics dashboard built with Streamlit and Plotly.

Decisions are classified as **APPROVE**, **HOLD**, or **REJECT** based on account status, KYC verification, balance checks, destination history, and AML risk rules.

---

## Requirements

```
Python 3.10+
streamlit >= 1.35
pandas >= 2.0
plotly >= 5.20
openpyxl >= 3.1
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r DashEngine/requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

Run from the project root:

```bash
streamlit run DashEngine/app.py
```

Then upload your `withdrawals.xlsx` file using the sidebar. The file must contain three sheets:

| Sheet | Key columns |
|---|---|
| `withdrawal_requests` | `request_id`, `account_id`, `client_id`, `amount`, `destination_id`, `requested_speed`, `created_at` |
| `account_snapshot` | `account_id`, `as_of`, `account_status`, `kyc_status`, `aml_risk_tier`, `available_cash`, `settled_cash` |
| `destination_registry` | `destination_id`, `last_changed_at`, `is_whitelisted` |

---

## Engine Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `BUFFER_USD` | $50 | Minimum balance required after withdrawal |
| `RECENT_DEST_DAYS` | 7 days | Destination must be unchanged for this period |
| `DUP_WINDOW_MIN` | 15 min | Window for duplicate request detection |
